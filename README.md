# School_District_Analysis
## After applying the loc statements to change Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores to NaN, the count of 461 NaN was verified thru student_data_df["reading_score"].isnull().sum(). But when running the scores in summary data frames such as per_school_summary_df, district_summary_df, and ninth_grade_reading (or math)_scores, none of them reflected the score changes. Further debugging is needed.
